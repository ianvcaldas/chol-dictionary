Spacing rules:
There are a number of spacing differences, mainly to do with the person markers. I will outline them here. I hope this captures them. 

the first person participant pluralizer (lac) in the SIL orthography is written separately from the word, buw not it is part of the word:


lac wut “our eye” should be in the new orthography lakwuty (the “lac” attaches to the following word.. also c—>k). 

Similarly, the second person plural la’ should be written without a space:

la’ pusic’al —> la’pusik’al (your (pl) heart)

Similarly, the third person marker “i” is written separately in the old orthography but it should be attached to the word:

Ma’anic i yʌts’mil jini bu’ul should be Ma’añik iyäts’mil jiñi bu’ul (the beans don’t have any seasoning

Other person markers need to be written separately:

a jol —> ajol (your head)
k jol —> kjol (my head)
i jol —> ijol (his head)
j co’ —> jco’ (my grandmother)

With words beginning in vowels the person markers change too. For instance the word otot (in new orthography “otyoty”) 

cotot —> kotyoty (no spacing difference here)
a wotot —> awotyoty (the second person maker is “a [space] w [NOUN]”
i yotoy —> iyotyoty (the third person marker is “i [space] y [NOUN]”

The other thing with spacing is the aspect markers. With the progressive aspect marker “woli” the third person is written like:

woli’ q’uel “he is seeing it” this should be “woli ik’el” so what happens here is the apostrophe deletes on “woli” and an “i” gets added to the verb

Similarly for “mi”

mi’ q’uel “he sees it” should be mi ik’el (the apostrophe deletes and i is added on the following word)

Also for the aspect marker “tsa’” this should be :

tsi’ q’uele “he saw it”, the new orthography should be “tsa’ ik’ele” so what happens here is that tsi’ becomes tsa’ and an “i” is added to the next word

For the first and second person the person markers are also written separately:

tsa’ wʌc’ʌ should be tsa’ awäk’ä (you all gave it) — what happens here is the apostrophe is deleted and an “a” gets added to the next word

For the first person as well:

Tsa la cʌc’ʌ  (we gave it) should be tsa’ lakäk’ä (an apostrophe is added to tsa’, then the space between la and cʌc’ʌ is deleted)

Also the exclusive plural “lojon” (new orthography: lojoñ) needs to be attached to the word BEFORE it:

c bʌ lojon (ourselves, exclusive) —> kbälojoñ

c jol lojon (our exclusive head) becomes kjolojoñ (another thing here is that if the word before it ends in an “l” then one of the “l”s needs to delete)
